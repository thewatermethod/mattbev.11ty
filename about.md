title: A little about me

You also might find me exploring New England, playing video games with my daughter, or taking care of my best dog friends.

I like to garden, write, [read](/bookshelf), and sit in the sun.

<!-- ## A note on technology

I am interested in accessibility, simple front end interfaces, and a minimal application of JavaScript. I'm looking forward to a world where "green", sustainable websites are a thing we talk about. -->
