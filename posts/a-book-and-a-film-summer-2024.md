Have really enjoyed a couple things I watched and/or read lately.

**_Perfect Days_, dir. Wim Wenders (movie)**

The premise (a few days in the life of a public toilet cleaner in Tokyo) is going to polarize; if you are immediately interested, you are primed for the film you are about to see. One incredible performance anchors this moving, meditative movie.

**_The Wheel of Doll_, by Jonathan Ames (book)**

The Doll series is about as hard-boiled of a crime novel as you can get, except Jonathan Ames writes with the beauty of Fitzgerald and with a protagonist who is basically a more sensitive and neurotic Bukowski. I couldn't put it down. Also definitely written by a man who owns a small dog.
