A rather miserable selection of movies watched this last October, but that's partially because I was on vacation for two weeks that month and had other things to do. When I was home, as you can see, I favored some comfort rewatches (Wickerman, Suspiria), and some movies I watched with my now 14 year-old daughter (Drag Me to Hell, Scream)

Big winner was The Vourdalak, a really inventive vampire movie. Weapons, the other real new one I watched was compelling but kind of incoherent.
