Because of _recent events_, I found myself revisiting the first few Black Sabbath albums. I don't know about you, but my mental list of Sabbath albums has shifted since the last time I devoted time to thinking about it.
Note I don't bother with Never Say Die or Technical Ecstasy here, or the post Ozzy ones.

Behold:

1. **Sabbath Bloody Sabbath** The big winner, I don't know where I would have ranked this before but it's a solid number one now.
2. **Master of Reality** Former number one
3. **Vol 4**
4. **Black Sabbath (self-titled)**
5. **Sabotage**
6. **Paranoid**

I also revisited Ozzy's solo stuff and can confirm that it mostly isn't my favorite, although there are some good songs on there. Blizzard of Oz has some truly incredible guitar stuff on it - can't be denied.
