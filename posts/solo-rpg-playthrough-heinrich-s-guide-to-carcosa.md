Over on my [dice website](https://cthulhudice.com/blogs/blog/solo-call-of-cthulhu-playthrough-heinrichs-guide-to-carcosa-part-1-character-creation), I started writing a solo playthough of Heinrich's Guide to Carcosa. I suppose I've completed some kind of transformation or passed some kind of thresohold if I am now posting solo role-playing-game playthroughs to the Internet

I also just migrated the thing to Shopify after 8 years of WooCommerce, which probably deserves it's own blog post. It's only been a couple of days so time will tell if that was worth it.
